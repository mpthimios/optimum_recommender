/**
 * <p>
 * <b>The Borda Count</b>
 * <p>
 * <b>Purpose:</b> To compute the winning candidate using the plurality voting
 * 			method from a set of ranked ballots.
 * <p>
 * <b>Input:</b>	The ballots as an array of the <code>Ballot</code> object
 * 			using the non-default constructor. The ballots as well as the
 * 			candidates' names must set in a different class. However the
 * 			information about the candidates does not need to be explicitly
 *			inputted, the information will be taken from the array ballots.
 * <p>
 * <b>Output:</b>	The name of the winning candidate if one exists, else the
 * 			string "Tie".
 * <p>
 * <b>Algorithm:</b>	In an election with <i>n</i> candidates/alternatives,
 * 			all candidates will	be awarded <i>n</i> - 1 points each time that
 * 			they are ranked first on a	ballot, <i>n</i> - 2 points every time
 * 			they are ranked second, and so forth. The candidate with the most
 * 			points wins.
 * <p>
 * <b>Precondition</b>	The array of ballots and the candidates names must be set.
 * <p>
 * <b>Relation with other classes</b> Inherits the ballots array  and the several
 * 				methods from VotingSystem.
